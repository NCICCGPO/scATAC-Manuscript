This folder contains code for doing the motif enrichment for differential peaks in GBM subclones and understanding enrichment of TF binding site


gbm_subclones_adult_fetal_motifs.ipynb file contains the enrichment test for the neural network cleaned vierstra motif sets between the differential peaks between the fetal and adult subclones in GBM45 and GBM39 samples. The reported enrichment odds ratios are averaged across the fetal and adult subclones in Fig 3.
